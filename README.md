# IoTGateway
Simple protocol and identity translating IotHub gateway. 

This project is in some essence similar to Azure IoT Hub Edge device project in sense that it is modular but does not use IotHub module concept. 

Purpose of this gateway is to talk to different legacy system nodes, poll their datasets, translate those into common format/structure and upload to IoT Hub.
